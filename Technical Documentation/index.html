            <p>React is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify development of visual interfaces. </p>  
            <p>Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of
                the most widely used code in the world,powering Facebook and Instagram among
                many, many other software companies. </p>
            <p>Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state 
                in any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of components.</p>

            <header  ><h1>Is React really that simple?</h1></header>  
            <p>Even though I said that React is simpler than alternative frameworks, diving 
               into React is still complicated, but mostly because of the corollary technologies
                that can be integrated with React, like Redux, Relay or GraphQL. </p>  
            <p>React in itself has a very small API.</p>
            <p>There isnâ€™t too much into React than these concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Component</li>
                <li>JSX</li>
                <li>State</li>
                <li>props</li>
                <li>redux</li>
            </ul>
            <code>npx install react react-dom --save</code><br>
            <code>npx install create-react-app app-name</code>

        <section id="JSX" class="main-section" >
            <header  ><h1>JSX</h1></header>  
            <p>Many developers, including who is writing this article, at first sight thought that 
                JSX was horrible, and quickly dismissed React.</p>  
            <p>Even though they said JSX was not required, using React without JSX was painful.</p>
            <p>It took me a couple years of occasionally looking at it to start digesting JSX, and 
                now I largely prefer it over the alternative, which is: using templates.</p>
            <code>const element =&#60;h1>Hello, world! &#60;/h1></code> <br>
            <code>const myId = 'test'<br>
                const element = 	&#60;h1 id={myId}>Hello, world!	&#60;/h1></code>

            <h1>What is a React component?</h1> 
            <p>A component is one isolated piece of interface. For example in a typical blog
            homepage you might find the Sidebar component, and the Blog Posts List component.
             They are in turn composed by components themselves, so you could have a list of 
             Blog post components, each for every blog post, and each with its own peculiar properties.</p>  
             <img src="https://jaxenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/react-intro-1.png" alt="React-component" />
            <p>Even plain HTML tags are component on their own, and they are added by default. </p>
            <p>The next 2 lines are equivalent, they do the same thing. One with JSX, one without, by injecting</p>
            <code>import React from 'react'<br>
                import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'<br>
                <br>
                ReactDOM.render(      <br>
                &#60;h1>Hello World!&#60;/h1>, <br>
                  document.getElementById('app') <br>
                ) <br>
                 
                ReactDOM.render( <br>
                  React.DOM.h1(null, "Hello World!"),<br>
